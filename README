A Simple Rough-like game (MSU CG course, A1 variant)
====================================================

This is an implementation of a simple
rough-like game with software rendering.

## Installing dependencies

I tried to minimized dependencies, so the only required libs are xcb-shm and xcb.
They can be installed:

 * On Debian derivatives (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu/Mint): `apt update && apt install libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-shm0-dev`
 * On Arch Linux (and derivatives): `pacman -S libxcb`
 * On Void Linux: `xbps-install -S libxcb-devel`

It also requires GNU or BSD make and GCC compiler

## Building and running 

This program can be run with

    make run

To compile a program you just need to

    make
